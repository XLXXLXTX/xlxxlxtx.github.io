    "about": "Hi! I’m Javier P. — a Computer Scientist from the University of Zaragoza focused on Software Development.\n\nWhile my professional experience has been centered on the Java ecosystem, I have been expanding my skills in technologies like React and Express to improve as a Full-Stack profile. I am also deeply interested in homelabbing and automation, where I enjoy tinkering with new tools and exploring different setups just for the sake of learning.\n\nMy goal is to continue learning in professional environments, providing practical solutions and growing with every new technical challenge that arises.",
